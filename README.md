# Grammar-Score-Prediction-from-Audio-using-Machine-Learning
The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model that can automatically assess a speakerâ€™s grammar proficiency, based on their speech audio. The task is framed as a supervised learning problem where the target is a grammar score ranging from 1 to 5. The evaluation metric used is Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
