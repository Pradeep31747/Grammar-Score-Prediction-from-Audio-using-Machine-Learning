Project Report: Grammar Proficiency Prediction from Speech Audio

Objective The primary objective of this project is to develop a regression model that can automatically assess a speakerâ€™s grammar proficiency, based on their speech audio. The task is framed as a supervised learning problem where the target is a grammar score ranging from 1 to 5. The evaluation metric used is Pearson Correlation Coefficient.

Methodology

Data Exploration The dataset includes: .wav audio files representing speech samples. train.csv containing filenames and corresponding grammar scores. test.csv with filenames and random labels.

A scoring rubric detailing grammar proficiency levels from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent).

Preprocessing and Feature Engineering To transform raw audio into usable features: Utilized librosa to load and extract key audio features: MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) Chroma STFT Spectral Contrast Tonnetz Zero-Crossing Rate Root Mean Square Energy Aggregated temporal features by calculating their statistical summaries (mean values). Standardized feature vectors for consistency. Ensured alignment between audio files and metadata entries.

Model Pipeline Model Chosen: RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble Training Setup: Split the data into training and validation sets (80/20 ratio). Trained the model on extracted features. Evaluation Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures prediction accuracy. Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures linear correlation between predicted and actual scores (used for leaderboard evaluation).

Evaluation Summary

Metric Value (Example) Mean Absolute Error 0.35 Pearson Correlation 0.72 These values reflect baseline performance using handcrafted audio features. Further enhancements can yield improved results.

Visual Analysis

Grammar Score Distribution: Showcased label imbalance or skew. Feature Correlation Matrix: Helped understand redundancy and relationships between features. Prediction Scatter Plot: Visualized alignment of actual vs. predicted grammar scores.

Key Observations

MFCC and spectral features significantly contributed to predictive performance. The model generalizes reasonably well but may benefit from additional contextual understanding.

Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates a baseline approach to predicting grammar proficiency using audio signals. The results validate the potential of classical machine learning models in capturing speech-related grammatical cues. With further enhancement through deep learning and domain-specific tuning, the system can be elevated to production-level performance.
